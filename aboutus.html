<p class= "peachBackground text"> Lisa and Adesola met at university in 2015 and have been best friends ever since. Whilst at university they both took up committee roles in the Afro-Caribbean society and Nigerian society respectively. Lisa took up the role of treasurer and as a way of keeping society costs down decided to bake cupcakes for their events rather than hiring external caterers. With Adesolaâ€™s help they were able to cater to events of 200+ people and word soon spread around campus that there were new bakers in town. Students started to ask to purchase birthday cakes and cupcakes and this continued until Adesola graduated in 2018. The two of them debated about whether they wanted to take things further for a while, until lockdown hit in March 2020. They decided it was now or never and CakeUp London was born..</p>
